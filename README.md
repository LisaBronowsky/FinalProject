# Final Project

Overview

Welcome to the Final Project repository! This project represents the culmination of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science final year, dedicated to creating an innovative solution for visually impaired individuals. An image recognition model designed to identify and label various fruits and vegetables was developed, enabling a more accessible and independent shopping experience for individuals with visual impairments.

Project Highlights

Objective: Develop an accurate and user-friendly image recognition model for fruits and vegetables.
Accessibility Focus: Tailored for visually impaired users, FruitVista aims to enhance their grocery shopping experience by providing real-time information about the items in their surroundings.
Technology Stack: Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the project utilizes popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Dataset: The model was trained on a diverse dataset encompassing a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, ensuring robust performance in various real-world scenarios.
User Interface: A minimalistic and intuitive user interface complements the model, making it accessible on different devices, including smartphones and specialized devices.
